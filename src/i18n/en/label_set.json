    "project.paragraph.bmob": "It was my first time working in the React ecosystem after developing in Android\/Kotlin. While learning a new language and framework was challenging, I rapidly improved through hands-on problem solving and refactoring. As the development team leader, I also managed the project and participated in planning. Some early design ideas were not technically feasible due to a lack of clear functional definitions and ERD understanding, which led me to realize the importance of detailed planning and QA. This experience strengthened my cross-functional perspective beyond coding.",
    "project.paragraph.daily_hangeul": "Haruhangul was a team project developed during the 2024 LikeLion Hackathon, where I led frontend development and deployment using GCP and Nginx. The biggest challenge was delivering a stable, high-quality service within a short timeframe. To address this, I reused previously built components and clearly communicated API requirements from a frontend perspective to backend developers. This approach significantly shortened the development timeline. Through this experience, I learned the importance of rapid problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and bridging the gap between planning and execution.",
    "project.paragraph.hangangnow": "Since there was no module available for implementing Kakao Map in React Native, I developed it by displaying a web version built with React through a WebView. It was a really enjoyable experience handling everything from event processing to data requests while switching between React Native and React.\\nAs the deadline was very tight, our planners and designers had a hard time, but it was a valuable experience that taught me both the importance and difficulty of working together as a team to meet deadlines.",
    "project.paragraph.knu_social": "I enjoyed developing this app with the motivation to provide a useful service for Kyungpook National University students. One major challenge was creating a wireframe from loosely defined natural-language requests made during meetings. It was difficult to fully grasp what the client truly wanted. To resolve this, I introduced a visual feedback cycle where I regularly shared mockups and refined them iteratively. This experience taught me the importance of clear requirement definitions and how crucial communication is in software development.",
    "project.paragraph.knumarket": "In the KnuMarket project, I found great value in working with a team of planners, designers, and backend engineers to solve problems together. The most challenging part was developing the chat feature. I initially lacked proper architectural planning, which led to a bug where new messages mixed with old ones due to asynchronous API and WebSocket calls. Debugging was impossible under the existing structure, so I refactored the module using the MVVM architecture and DI pattern. Through this, I learned the importance of system design and the value of structured development approaches.",
    "project.paragraph.lovydovy": "Through this project, I challenged myself for the first time to develop not only the frontend using React and React Native but also the backend using Node.js and Firebase Functions. At first, it was difficult to grasp backend-specific concepts like API design, networking, databases, and ORM, which are quite different from frontend development. However, I tackled these challenges by reading documentation and experimenting with real code. This hands-on approach allowed me to build a deeper understanding of platform architecture. Ultimately, the experience helped me realize the value of full-stack perspective and greatly strengthened my development versatility.",
